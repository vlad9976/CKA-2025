## üìù Pod Manifest Examples & Commands

### **pod.yaml**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: pod
metadata:
  name: mywebserver
spec:
  containers:
    - name: mywebserver
      image: nginx
```
- `apiVersion` = Version of API  
- `kind` = Kind of object you want to create  
- `metadata` = Name of object that uniquely identifies it  
- `name`  
- `spec` = Desired state of the object

### **kubectl**
```bash
# Create pod from yaml file
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml

# Delete everything that is part of the yaml file
kubectl delete -f pod.yaml
```

### **Generating Pod Manifests via CLI**
```bash
# 1. Create a Pod from Nginx Image
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx

# 2. Create a Pod and Expose a Port
kubectl run nginx-port --image=nginx --port=80

# 3. Output the Manifest File
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --port=80 --dry-run=client -o yaml

# 4. Delete PODS
kubectl delete pod nginx
kubectl delete pod --all
```

### **Expose-pod.yaml**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: democontainer
    ports:
      - containerPort: 8080
```
> List of ports to expose from the container.  
> Not specifying a port here DOES NOT prevent that port from being exposed.  
> Any port which is listening on the default "0.0.0.0" address inside a container will be accessible from the network.
